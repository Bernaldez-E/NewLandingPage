                    As for skills, I don't really have a particular set of skills that I can flaunt out. I'm more of the person who likes to know the basics. Like a jack of all trades type of person. For example in the house, I'm mostly the person to call if there's like a problem in some devices. Not just in device's, this can also be with some software. I did have a basic rundown in computer maintenance. Some knowledge in troubleshooting with appliances as well. Well I don't know if you can call this a skill, but I was working before as a Technical Support Advisor for an international company. And I was certified and was actually about to be promoted there, but then the whole pandemic happened and it got pushed down. Well I think that's the gist of it for me in the skills.
