                    As for my interest, the oldest thing I can remember that I was mostly interested was with the thing with Power Rangers. I do remember watching them on televisions and I was asking for a suit and things from the show. I remember that my parents bought me the transforming belt from the show. I routine use it daily for like a couple of months before it broke down. Me and my friends were complete in the set for it. We sometimes reenact the show outside while playing. I also remember me having begged for a costume for Robin from Batman. He is also one of my favorites before, well up until today. From Robin to Nightwing, basically the first Robin all grownup. Well those were my interest.
