                    In my College Year, I still continued here at the University of the East.<sup>1</sup> 
					I pursued the course of IT since I was more acquainted to it.<sup>2</sup> 
					I was supposed to finish all 4 years in continuation, but due to some financial problems I only got to finish 1 semester of my 1st year.<sup>3</sup> 
					After that I tried and found a job for myself, I was referred to a job by my sister.<sup>4</sup> 
					It was a job for a company called AT&T.<sup>5</sup> 
					It was actually nerve wracking to think my first job would be there, an international company.<sup>6</sup> 
					I was very nervous on the interview but I managed to get accepted and actually work immediately after the interview.<sup>7</sup> 
					There I was able to experience what is was like to have a job and communicate with some people internationally.<sup>8</sup> 
					I got working there shorty as a Technical Support Adviser.<sup>9</sup> 
					I met some wonderful people there and a mentor that would constantly share his wisdom to us, his story, his view, and experience.<sup>10</sup> 
					I met some teammates that I could call brothers and sisters, met some friends that I truly trust.<sup>11</sup> 
					Worked there for a year, and was actually finding it comfortable to work.<sup>12</sup> 
					But things don't usually go to your way, a year after working there my job would be cut short because of the pandemic.<sup>13</sup> 
					I was jobless and got nothing to do because of it.<sup>14</sup> 
					Spent almost 2 years of my life at home helping with things in the house.<sup>15</sup> 
					After some time I remembered to finish my college, after talking to my family they all we're okay and I continued studying for my college.<sup>16</sup> 
					So here we are, after a few years I got back to the University of the East.<sup>17</sup> 
					Continued my studies with IT, was actually thinking of shifting to Psychology since it piqued my interest more at that time.<sup>18</sup> 
					Met some of my old batchmates which just graduated from their college last year, they helped me, motivated me to finish what I started.<sup>19</sup> 
					That's I can add up to my present college life as of now.<sup>20</sup>
