                    I was born in Manila where my parents used to live.<sup>1</sup> My father was an OFW, while my Mother was a housewife.<sup>2</sup> I was the only boy of their three children, the other two were girls.<sup>3</sup> Growing up, I usually spent my time in my grandparents, there I spent most of my days outside and playing with my friends.<sup>4</sup> I loved being outdoors, and I had a deep appreciation for nature and would occasionally be sky gazing.<sup>5</sup> My parents instilled strong values in me, such as hard work, responsibility, and respect for others.<sup>6</sup> I attended a small school, and I was somewhat of a slow learner.<sup>7</sup> I was fascinated by science, especially biology and astronomy.<sup>8</sup> I loved reading books and exploring the natural world.<sup>9</sup> I remember using our computer and playing Microsoft Encarta.<sup>10</sup> This was like a multimedia encyclopedia.<sup>11</sup> This helped me with learning since I had difficulties.<sup>12</sup> I was also was an avid chess player in elementary, and would often play with my classmates and teachers.<sup>13</sup> I was fond of playing computer at a young age.<sup>14</sup> I got my first taste of it when I was like 5 years old.<sup>15</sup> It was when my sister was playing her PS1.<sup>16</sup> Couple of years I got my first device which was a Gameboy Advance, in which I played often with my friends.<sup>17</sup> Then after that I got myself a PS2 thanks of my grades at the time, in which I spent most of my hobby playing it.<sup>18</sup> If not the console I was playing outside, in which I often got in trouble because of how long I was outside.<sup>19</sup> It was a fun childhood to say the least.<sup>20</sup>
