                    In my teenage years, I began to develop a passion for technology and computers.<sup>1</sup> 
					As a teen I began to meddle with the family computer to the point I began trying to open it up and check the insides.<sup>2</sup> 
					I also tend to pick things apart such as remotes and toys just to see the parts of them.<sup>3</sup>
					This prompt me to hang out at my uncle's place since he repairs computers and other appliances.<sup>4</sup>
					I remember helping him on the repairs especially when it comes to computers.<sup>5</sup>
					During this time I got myself involve with music.<sup>6</sup>
					In which I would often borrow the guitar of my sister, and sometimes practice playing the drums.<sup>7</sup>
					It was also a time where I began to participate in some physical activities such as playing soccer and tae kwon do.<sup>8</sup>
					In which I met some of my trusted friends and began to expand my point of view slowly through them and by the games I played.<sup>10</sup>
					I do remember the games such as Metal Gear and Warframe leaving a philosophical view in life.<sup>11</sup>
					I still follow the view learned from those games up until now.<sup>12</sup>
					During this period of my life I would also come to acquaint with my ever blurring eyesight and astigmatism.<sup>13</sup>
					At this time I mostly go out with my friends and visit place to place not really getting serious with my study.<sup>14</sup>
					I was only doing the bare necessity in terms on my study, and actually finish my high school with an average grade but enjoyable high school life.<sup>15</sup>
					After that we became the first batch of the new K-12 program, the first batch of senior high.<sup>16</sup>
					I chose to study at the University of the East and pursue the the strand of STEM.<sup>17</sup>
					I thought we would be taught some basics of the computer there but it was mostly on mathematical and scientific subjects.<sup>18</sup>
					I did still enjoy my senior high here even though the course I picked was not really in line with what I want to learn.<sup>19</sup>
					Well that's most for my teenage year.<sup>20</sup>
